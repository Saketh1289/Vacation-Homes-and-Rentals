- Connect a MySQL database:
    >For development environment:
    <br>
    In **VacationRentals/settings.py** replace the following code snippet according to your mysql database.

    ```
    DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': '<databasename>',
        'USER': '<username>',
        'PASSWORD': '<password>',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
        }
    }
    ```

- For running the application simply execute the following commands:

    ```
    $python manage.py migrate
    $python manage.py runserver
    ```

- If you want to populate database with dummy data as shown in preview:
    ```
    $python manage.py loaddata Rentals.json
    ```
